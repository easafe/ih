raw ideas to refine

* take ideas from insighthack
    - setting?
    - monters?
    - keep the wacky stuff, easter eggs and other bs but no 4th wall breaking

* core mechanics
    - "realistic" combat
        1. no hit points
        2. clear reasons for injury/death (that can be exploited)

    - discoverability
        1. everything starts off as unidentified or vague
        2. everything in the game should be discoverable (in a way that can be predicted)

* mechanics
    - usual roguelike mechanics
        1. permadeath
        2. level generation
        3. turn based

    - easy to use ui
        1. mouse movements
        2. buttons
        3. do not dump commands on players
        4. cogmind like graphics?

* levels
    - instead of dungeon floors make an open world with branching paths
        1. levels are still randomly generated but they have difficulty levels to guide progression
        2. levels are interconnected

    - required and optional levels

    - a final goal that can only be taken on after doing other smallers goals
        1. example: a final area that can only be accesced by collecting items spread out/taking on foes
        2. the fun should in the exploration, not getting to the end

    - field of vision fog of war?

* other
    - factions to join/fight

    - actual reasons why someone is hostile or not

    - past gameplay ghosts

* character progression

* items

* monster

* npcs

* specs
    - computer program, not browser

    - idris2

    - sdl and maybe opengl

    - prolly wont need crazy performance
